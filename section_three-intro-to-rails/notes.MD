# MVC - Model, View, Controller

## General flow of Rails application:

> Request made at browser

> Request received at router of rails application

> Request routed to appropriate controller

> Controller either renders a view template or communicates with model

> Model communicates with database

> Model sends back information to controller

> Controller renders view
